# TSA Band

This theme was made for the Technology Student Assosiation National Student Conference, which is in National Harbor, Maryland.

I am a staunch believer in open source code, so if you feel the need to use this code for your own project, feel free! I only ask that you do attempt to use this for your TSA project. Overall, it was a lot of fun to learn so many new things about web design, and I urge people who don't know about web design to participate in the Website Design event as you can learn so much in the process of builing a site.

I plan on making this theme a free to use bootstrap theme when the competition is over, as it has served it's purpose to me.
